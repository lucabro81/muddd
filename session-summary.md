# Session Summary

This document outlines the progress made during our last session and the immediate plan for our next one.

## Accomplishments

1.  **`drop` Command Implemented**: We successfully added the parser logic for the `drop` command in `packages/core/src/parser/command-parser.ts`, completing its functionality.

2.  **Architectural Refactor for State Updates**: We implemented a robust system for handling game state updates.
    - **New `StateUpdatedEvent`**: Created a new event type to signal that the world state has changed.
    - **`processEvent` Wrapper**: Implemented a `processEvent` function that wraps the recursive `applyEvent` function. This ensures that for complex, multi-stage commands, only a single, final state update is broadcast to listeners.
    - **Server Integration**: Refactored the main server event listener in `apps/server/src/game-event-emitter.ts` to use the new `processEvent` system, making our state management more atomic and reliable.

## Plan for Next Session: Stream Interruption (Server-Side)

Our next goal is to allow players to skip the streaming of long descriptions. The first step is to modify the server.

1.  **Add Stream Boundary Messages**:

    - **File**: `apps/server/src/game-event-emitter.ts`
    - **Action**: In the `LookRoomEvent` and `LookTargetEvent` handlers, send `{"type": "stream_start"}` to the client _before_ the streaming loop begins and `{"type": "stream_end"}` _after_ it concludes.

2.  **Implement Server-Side Interruption Logic**:
    - **Goal**: Allow the client to send an "interrupt" message that the server can act upon mid-stream.
    - **Action 1 (Data Structure)**: Create a shared `Set` (e.g., `interruptedStreams`) to hold the `connectionId` of any client that requests an interruption.
    - **Action 2 (Message Handling)**: Modify the main WebSocket message handler (likely in `apps/server/src/routes.ts`) to listen for a new message type, like `{"type": "interrupt_stream"}`. When received, it should add the client's `connectionId` to the `interruptedStreams` set.
    - **Action 3 (Loop Modification)**: Inside the description streaming loops in `game-event-emitter.ts`, add a check at the start of each iteration. If the current client's `connectionId` is in the `interruptedStreams` set, the server should `break` the loop, clean up the `Set`, and stop sending data to that client.
